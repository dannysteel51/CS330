How do I approach designing software?

I like to approach designing software in two ways: the first is to design modularly. This means I code small sections at a time while also creating reusable functions to limit redundant code. And secondly, I like to take my time, sketch out ideas, read alternative documents, research other methods, and seek out additional help. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I've been tinkering around with Unreal and Unity for over a year now. And in that time, I thought I understood how creating 3D meshes work, but I've discovered that the engine does much of the heavy lifting. Creating objects from scratch using OpenGL is much harder than expected. But it did give me a better understanding of how to create and display shapes and how lighting works. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?

For the milestones, I employed a build-upon process, which is to say I built upon previous work. Starting from the beginning, I built a single object, the cylinder. From there, I created a handle, which I used to make my complex 3D Mug. From there, the plane for my scene. The following week, I added more objects and movement. The following week, I added another object and texture. Then lighting. Finally, the finishing touches. In a way, I built how I code, one step at a time, building on what I've already accomplished. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

It's taught me to take my time, research, build on what I already know, and not be afraid to ask for help.

How do I approach developing programs?

As I stated before, I like to take my time and think things out, learn as much as possible, watch tutorials, query search engines, and then build modularly, adding on to what I already know.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Trial and error. Trying to get an object to display on the right part of the scene wasn't so difficult as it was time-consuming. Altering little increments at a time, trying to get the object in the right spot, took patience through trial and error.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was at the core of what I did. I did one step, checked it, and messed around until I got it the way I wanted. And from there, I built on top of that. In this way, iterating through things I already knew how to do, adding more and more to the scene, I slowly built my project, but more than that, it was allowing me some much need practice.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I've slowed down. Before I'd rush, in an attempt to get to the end. But with this project and the intricacies of OpenGL, I found this was a recipe for disaster. Around week three of the term, I found myself angry and lost. I took a break, took a pause, and when I returned, I followed the tutorials more closely, not trying to skim to get to the end. I did small bits at a time rather than attempting to complete it all in one day. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

My goal is to work in the Game Industry. Without computer science, I'm not sure that would be possible. I might be able to work in some form within a game company, but not developing, which is where I want to be.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I now understand HOW graphics work from the ground up. It is no longer a mystery. And with that knowledge, any future lessons that deal with graphics or visualizations, I will feel more ready to take on the challenge.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

With this foundation, I feel like I can better understand how to work in Unreal and Unity, as well as OpenGL itself, to further my skills, hopefully giving me a better chance at landing my dream job.
